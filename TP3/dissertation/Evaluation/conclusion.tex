\section{Summary}

Some formal testing allowed us to be fairly confident that the core functionality of our system is working. However, much of our testing was unstructured. We regret not testing that functions were working from version to version of our system, in case we were introducing defects. It would've been useful to have a Java class to simulate activity that could achieve such an aim. Despite this, we have succeeded in developing a robust and reliable application.
