\section{Client}

\subsection{Overview}

This section will outline the process of implementing our client design. While implementing the client, it became clear that some of our larger design choices were niave, and further design work had to be conducted. These changes will be discussed in the 'design changes' section. In some cases, smaller design choices required larger changes. Of particular significance, our understanding of the practical working of the GIM protocol to create personal chats, and single chats proved to be ill informed. This required design work reaching over the protocol, and to a degree the model component of the system. This process tested our ability to collaborate as a team to implement an interacting system. The degree of our success will be discussed in the 'Collaboration' section. Furthermore, as we became more familiar with the swing environment, our code went through evolutionary steps to implement certain features in a more sensible manner, such as how displaying updates to user information was handled. The 'Evolution of Code' section will discuss problems we identified with code which was functional, but deemed to be hard to maintain on reviewing our code, and the merits of our changes we nade.
