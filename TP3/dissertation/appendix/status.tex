\label{appenstatus}

The program is stable and does not appear to have any substantial bugs. The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem definition. \\

{\bf List of known issues with GIM:}
\begin{itemize}

\item{In some instances, a contact will come online and cause the users' contact list to stop displaying contacts. The user can fix this by selecting the "Display Offline Users" option.}

\item{A long line of text will necessitate the user to scroll across the chat area, as oposed to the text wrapping round.}

\item{The Block feature acts more like an ignore feature; the user that blocks a contact still appears online that contact.}

\item{If a user goes offline while talking to a contact, any messages that the contact sends while the user is offline will be send when they sign back online, assuming the contact remains online. This could be considered a feature of the system, as this it is a partial implementation of offline messages. As the user is not made aware that this will happen, the issue is considered a defect.}

\end{itemize}
