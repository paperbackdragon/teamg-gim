\section{Schedule}

As with any software project, planning is an important aspect. As is to be expected from a group without prior experience in team work, the original schedule was overly optimistic. Other course deadlines and a failure to appriciate the time requirements of each stage resulted in a failure to meet our planned deadlines.

The process of designing the system took longer than was initially anticipated, which delayed the implementation process significantly. The implementation process for basic functionality went smoothly and was finished relatively quickly, however a significant amount of time was spent improving the interface and polishing the program.
