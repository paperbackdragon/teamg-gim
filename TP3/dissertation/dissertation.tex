\begin{abstract}
GIM is a client/server instant messaging application implemented in the Java Language. Comparable to many other similar programs, GIM allows users to communicate over a network with text based messages, using our own proprietary protocol. This dissertation discusses the process of developing GIM from the initial problem definition, though to completion.

\begin{acknowledgements}
Thanks to Colin Perkins for supervising this project, and being the voice of reason in those rare moments when panic set in.

For his excellent art work, we would like to thank our fellow student Matt Roszak. Without any brief, he provided an excellent logo and icon set for us, giving up his spare time in the process.

We would also like to thanks all of those who helped test the program, even in those early stages without the pretty GUI.
